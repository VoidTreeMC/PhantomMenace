Phantoms don't attack players unless they haven't slept for awhile. You can change how long it's been since a player slept by modifying their Statistic, TIME_SINCE_REST.

When players enter the arena, they should have their statistic set to something like 100k. When they leave the arena, it should be set back to whatever it was before.

Phantoms don't light players on fire when they hit them.


Or, make it so they drink a potion to be part of it.

Turn off weather in the arena
