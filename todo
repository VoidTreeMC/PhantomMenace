General Changes
===
If a phantom explodes on you, you should get credit for its kills
Have the tiny phantoms constantly target the MOAP to make it look like a swarm of bees
Make a dedicated file for constants, especially names for items.
- Maybe ender blade has a 5% chance to teleport your enemy a few blocks into the air so they fall and take damage

Bugs
===
Limit creeper fireworks that can go off in a row
Skipwave doesnt work if it spawns a wave with 0 phantoms
Proton died and didn't get any immunity period from the event. There were no exceptions in the console.
  - This may be fixed? Other people haven't noticed it.
  - Apparently it came up again at this event and it happened to proton again. I need to do some in-depth testing on this
