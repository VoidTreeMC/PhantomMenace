Phantoms that give you levitation

Show bossbar to everyone on the server
 - or maybe to just those that drink the potion?
As phantoms in each wave die, tick down the bossbar
When the wave ends, announce top 5 players that killed the most phantoms
When the event ends, announce the top 5 players that killed the most phantoms
- give them a prize, maybe?

Make it so when the event is happening, it modifies the worldguard region to allow skeletons to spawn. Then, after it ends, it resets it so that skeletons can't spawn

Can use lava walkers to make infinite obsidian
Make it so lava walkers don't work while mounted on a strider

TODO: Refactor some of the PhantomEvent code to be less repetitive. Some methods can be merged
TODO: Make a dedicated file for constants, especially names for items.
